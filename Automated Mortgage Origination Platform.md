## Recommendations

To getting out of the bad situation, the company should de-emphasizing mortgage rate comparison shopping, more acting as a mortgage origination and application processing one stop portal for the winning lender. 


The company has three main sources of competitive strength: its technology, its size and its brand. 

Its main lead generation business lacks of creditability and causes bad user experience among its most crucial constituents, the mortgage borrowers. Currently the conversion for a mortgage application is below 1%. Instead of acting as a mortgage rate comparison shopping tool and a lead generation platform for the lenders, it should be going back to its root as its domain name implied. The emphasizing on mortgage origination and application one stop processing portal will gender good will from the ultimate customers, the borrowers and improve their user experience.

If the company decides to go into the mortgage application processing business. It will have to 

* Build out the mortgage application one stop processing system by utilizing the latest technology. 

	* One trend is to integrate the traditional application work flow with the latest voice and mobile communication technology, to promote the just in time communication between the borrowers and the lenders.
	 
	* Another trend is to implement the latest electronic signing technology using the services from DocuSign and Adobe Sign, etc. The will remove the document printing and in person signing, the most time consuming steps within the application process. Furthermore, it also minimizes the intensive paper usage and protect the environment.
	

* Integrate its newly built mortgage application processing system with the large financial institutions with the lending facilities, like banks and credit unions to provide start to finish seamless application experience. 

These two stages of technology development will help the company develop into a centralized platform for mortgage lending and provide the mortgage borrowers with a single point of platform for an end-to-end solution.
